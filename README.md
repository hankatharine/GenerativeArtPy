# Generative Art in Python
Experimenting with generative art in Python using Turtle Graphics.

## Background
Generative art is created by giving a program a set of random variables and it being able to output something unique every single time.
In this repo, I plan to experiment with different generative art concepts using Turtle Graphics.

## DiagonalLines.py
Using a tutorial from https://spin.atomicobject.com/2021/12/14/generative-art-zero-random/ I was able to start my generative art journey by outputting a grid with
various lines and colours.
